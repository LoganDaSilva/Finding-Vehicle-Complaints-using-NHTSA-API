Shortly thereafter, I was driving on the highway when the vehicle stalled out and  the wheel became very hard to control. I managed to avoid causing a major accident and made it to the side of the highway where I then sat for over 4 hours stranded. After trying to start my Jeep it  just started up out of the blue and I drove home.  I was nervous to drive it but I had no other mode of transportation.  Over the next few months it would increasingly stall out. Sometimes in mid turn , sometimes on the expressway and sometimes just not start at all.  A recall came out and I was able to have the truck \" repaired \".  Not even a month later it started to do the same thing. Stalling in mid drive. not starting at all or starting in Neutral only.   I took it to a different dealership and paid over 300$ for them to  do a diagnosis.  Their diagnosis consisted of a \" walk around \" and taking a video of the vehicle.  What a waste of money. As I was going to leave the dealership the vehicle wouldn\\'t start.  Then after an hour it suddenly started.  I had advised service about it and they said that I can leave the vehicle and have them look at it when they had time which they said would be 4 days from then.  I said you just looked at it and did nothing and I had to pay 300$ for nothing to be diagnosed. I was able to get the car home and then the car didnt start for a week then started .. would drive it then stalled and have to have it towed home a couple of times. Now the truck has been sitting in my driveway not able to start  at all. The fuel pump relay was supposed to be replaced by two recalls I believe. Nothing was fixed and infact it only had made it worse probably causing damage to the rest of my vehicle. I am lucky I didnt crash, or even kill someone because of this.

However, within a year of having the recall work done I had the BRAKE warning light come on while driving and noticed that my brake pedal was extremely firm when trying to start my vehicle.  I made an appointment at a Jeep dealer to have the problem diagnosed and fixed immediately but the problem went away before my scheduled appointment.

Thankfully even though the light had gone off by the time I got it to the dealer they said the error code was still stored and came back as \"C0021-02\" or \"Brake Booster -  General Signal Failure\" that likely indicates a failing brake booster BUT the dealer also said I was out of warranty and so no work would be covered even though the brake booster recall work led to this dangerous intermittent failure.

I?M A MECHANICAL ENGINEER BY TRADE AND IN MY 60 YEARS OF LIFE I HAVE SEEN AND WORK ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT CARS AND I KNOW THAT CAN HAPPEN IN SITUATIONS SIMILAR TO THIS.  THE PORTION OF THE VISIBLE THREADS ON THE FRONT AXLE CAME OUT OF THE SHAFT LIKE REMOVING A SLEEVE AND CRUMBLED LIKE BREAD CRUMBS  WHAT IS TO SAY THAT THE PORTION OF THE THREAD ENGAGED WITH THE NUT ON THE SHAFT (WHICH ISN'T VISIBLE AT THIS STAGE) WON'T HAVE THE SAME END RESULTS?   WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO A CAR DRIVING 65 ML/H ON A HIGHWAY WHEN A FRONT WHEEL WILL FALL OUT?  IS MY CAR JUST A BLACK SHEEP? IS THE LOT THAT MY CAR WAS PRODUCED SOMETHING OUT OF ORDINARY? THE AMOUNT OF RUST HAS DESTROYED THE THREADS ON THE VISIBLE PART OF THE AXLE.  IN MY OPINION THIS IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.   I HAVE PURCHASED EXTENDED WARRANTY WHEN I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE AND I WILL BE AT THE DEALER TOMORROW TO REPAIR IT    I WOULD LIKE CHRYSLER TO EVALUATE THE PROBLEM AND TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTIONS TO FIX THE PROBLEM PREVENTING LIFE'S BEING LOST.    AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PHOTOS THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF THREADS LEFT ON THE AXLES.  EVALUATE BETTER.

I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW FRIGHTENING THIS WAS. I MANAGED TO STOP THE CAR BY SHIFTING IT BACK INTO PARK. I WAS ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WAS NOT GOING VERY FAST.   SINCE 2/12 (TIME OF PURCHASE) UNTIL 8/14 I HAVE RECEIVED 3 RECALLS (CYLINDER MISFIRE, BRAKE BOOSTER AND SUN VISOR WIRING) ON THIS BRAND NEW VEHICLE! I RECEIVED THE BRAKE BOOSTER RECALL IN THE SUMMER OF 2014. IT TOOK A FEW MONTHS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE IT FIXED BECAUSE OF LACK OF PARTS IN STOCK. I FINALLY GOT AN APPOINTMENT ON 10/8/14 AT KELLY JEEP, LYNNFIELD, MA (PLACE OF PURCHASE) TO HAVE BOTH THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND THE SUN VISOR WIRING REPAIRED. THE CYLINDER MISFIRE WAS REPAIRED BEFORE THIS TIME AND BEFORE I ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE RECALL BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING WITH THE ENGINE.  AFTER THE BRAKES FAILING ME TODAY, I AM GRATEFUL THAT I WAS NOT ON THE STREET/HIGHWAY, THAT NONE OF MY CHILDREN WERE DRIVING THE CAR OR I WAS NOT DRIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD IN A CARPOOL. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT IF THE BRAKES FAILED JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OR EVEN WORSE, HAVE KILLED SOMEONE ELSE, FOR THE FAILURE OF THE BRAKE BOOSTER THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY FIXED ON 10/8/14.  *TR\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2012', 'productMake': 'JEEP', 'productModel': 'GRAND CHEROKEE', 'manufacturer': 'Chrysler (FCA US, LLC)'}]}, {'odiNumber': 10700573, 'manufacturer': 'Chrysler (FCA US, LLC)', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '03/17/2015', 'dateComplaintFiled': '03/20/2015', 'vin': '1C4RJEAGXCC', 'components': 'ELECTRICAL SYSTEM', 'summary': 'TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE.

I CALLED MY JEEP SERVICE CENTER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE REPAIR PART FOR THIS RECALL IS ON BACKORDER DUE TO A PARTS SHORTAGE.  I WAS ASKED TO BE PUT ON A LIST AND THEY WOULD CALL ME WHEN THE PART ARRIVES.  I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER ON DECEMBER 18, 2014 (4 MONTHS LATER).  I WAS TOLD THAT I AM NUMBER 124 ON THE WAITING LIST AND THAT THEY WERE ONLY AT NUMBER 40.  I WAS TOLD THAT CHRYSLER ONLY SENDS THE SERVICE CENTER ONE REPAIR PART AT A TIME AND WHEN THEY COMPLETE ONE REPAIR, THEN CHRYSLER SENDS THEM ANOTHER REPAIR PART FOR THE NEXT CUSTOMER.  I THEN ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER IF IT IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH THIS FAULTY PART - HE DID NOT ANSWER ME - ALL HE SAID WAS THAT \"HE KNOWS WHAT I KNOW\".  ALSO A FRIGHTENING SCENARIO.     DURING THE 4 MONTHS THAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS REPAIR, I RECEIVED ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE FOR AN ALTERNATOR DIOIDE THAT MAY EXPERIENCE RAPID FAILURE IN WHICH VOLTAGE MAY DROP TO CRITICAL LEVELS AND DISABLE THE ANTILOCK BRAKES, THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL, THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE, AND THE CENTRAL BODY CONTROLLER.  THIS MAY LEAD TO VEHICLE SHUTDOWN AND/OR AN ELECTRICAL FIRE.  THIS RECALL NOTICE STATES PLAINLY THAT \"THE PARTS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A PERMANENT REMEDY FOR THIS CONDITION ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE\".

ON APRIL-2014 I CALLED AGAIN JEEP REPRESENTATIVE IN PR AND EXPLAINED ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING, HE THEN SET UP ANOTHER SERVICE ON CHRYSLER/JEEP  DEALER PUERTO RICO AND ON 04/21/2014 THE DEALER REPRESENTATIVE TOOK MY CAR FOR REPAIR AND SAID THEY CHANGED AGAIN THE SHOCK ABSORBERS (REAR) FOR THE THIRD TIME AND ALSO CHANGED ANOTHER PIECE TO FIX THE FRONT NOISE. AGAIN FOR 2 WEEKS THE REAR NOISE DISAPPEARED AND NOW RETURNED LOUDER AND ALSO ON THE FRONT OF THE CAR MAKES A SNAP NOISE EVERY TIME I START THE CAR AND SOMETIMES WHEN I MAKE TURNS (LEFT AND RIGHT).
